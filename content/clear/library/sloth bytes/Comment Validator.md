# Valid JavaScript Comments

In JavaScript, there are two types of comments:

1. Single-line comments start with `//`
2. Multi-line or inline comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`

The input will be a sequence of `//`, `/*` and `*/`. **Every** `/*` **must have a** `*/` **that immediately follows it**. To add, there can be **no single-line comments in between multi-line comments** in between the `/*` and `*/`.

Create a function that returns `True` if comments are properly formatted, and `False` otherwise.

## Examples

```python
comments_correct("//////") 
output = True
# 3 single-line comments: ["//", "//", "//"]

comments_correct("/**//**////**/")
output = True
# 3 multi-line comments + 1 single-line comment:
# ["/*", "*/", "/*", "*/", "//", "/*", "*/"]

comments_correct("///*/**/")
output = False
# The first /* is missing a */

comments_correct("/////")
output = False
# The 5th / is single, not a double //
```
